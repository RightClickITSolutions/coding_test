  QUESTION 2:
  A milk carton can hold 3.78 liters of milk. Each morning, a dairy farm ships cartons of milk to a local grocery store. The cost of producing one liter of milk is ₦250, and the profit of each carton of milk is ₦180. Write a program that does the following:
  - Prompts the user to enter the total amount of milk produced in the morning.
  - Outputs the number of milk cartons needed to hold milk. (Round your answer to the nearest integer).
  - Outputs the cost of producing milk.
  - Outputs the profit for producing milk.



NOTES AND CALCULATIONS:

	1 carton of milk = 3.78 litres
	Cost per litre of milk = ₦250
	Profit per carton = ₦180

Therefore,
	Cost price per carton = ₦250 x 3.78 = ₦945
	Selling price per carton is: ₦945 + ₦180 =  ₦1,125
	Number of cartons produced = amount (in litres) / 3.78 litres
	Total cost of production = ₦250 x amount (in litres)
	Total selling price = ₦1,125 x number of cartons
	Total profit = total selling price - total cost price  OR  number of cartons x ₦180
