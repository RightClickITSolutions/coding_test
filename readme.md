Because of the tests that requires collecting input from the user,
I installed the prompt-sync node package to enable command line prompt,
otherwise you have to run the code in browser console.

To run the programs in the command line
simply run 'node filename' in the terminal,
where filename is the name of the test

e.g:
node test_1

ps: you need to have nodejs installed for this to work.
